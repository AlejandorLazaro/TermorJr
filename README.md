# Tremor Jr.
A repo to host my Fall 2012 Game Development project, 'Tremor Jr.'! This project was focused on design alone, and no code was written up for the project.

## Structure

The project is organized as follows:

* sprites - this folder contains the sprites that were generated to be used in-game
* concept - images and documents that were used when creating Tremor Jr. as a concept
* documents - files pertaining to the project, such as outlines, proposals, level design, etc
